### Example: Bug Fix Commit

```
fix: correct EBSIOBalance% alarm threshold

Fix incorrect alarm threshold for EBSIOBalance%:
- Changed from P2 < 50% to P2 < 70%
- Changed from P1 < 30% to P1 < 50%

Reason: Previous thresholds were too aggressive and caused
false positives during normal burst consumption.

Affected instances:
- bingo-prd (5 instances)
- bingo-stress (3 instances)
- pgsqlrel (2 instances)

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Duplicate Titles**

‚ùå **Avoid**:
```
commit 1: docs: add CloudWatch deployment record
commit 2: docs: add CloudWatch deployment record  ‚Üê Same title!
```

‚úÖ **Better**:
```
commit 1: docs: add Stress/Release RDS monitoring record
commit 2: docs: add dashboard cleanup and tools record
```

### 2. **Vague Descriptions**

‚ùå **Avoid**:
```
docs: update files
feat: add stuff
fix: fix bug
```

‚úÖ **Better**:
```
docs: add autovacuum monitoring guide
feat: create Python script for RDS analysis
fix: resolve widget alignment in Stress dashboard
```

### 3. **Missing Context**

‚ùå **Avoid**:
```
docs: add record

Added deployment record.
```

‚úÖ **Better**:
```
docs: add dashboard cleanup deployment record

Document removal of 9 invalid Performance Insights widgets
from Production, Release, and Stress RDS dashboards.

Impact: Eliminates "No data available" warnings.
```

### 4. **Too Much Detail in Title**

‚ùå **Avoid**:
```
docs: add comprehensive deployment record documenting dashboard cleanup and autovacuum tools
```

‚úÖ **Better**:
```
docs: add dashboard cleanup and autovacuum tools

<Details in body>
```

### 5. **No Separation Between Commits**

When making multiple related changes, ensure each commit has a **distinct purpose**:

‚ùå **Avoid**:
```
commit 1: docs: update documentation
commit 2: docs: update documentation  ‚Üê Not helpful!
```

‚úÖ **Better**:
```
commit 1: docs: add deployment procedures
commit 2: docs: add troubleshooting guide
commit 3: docs: add rollback instructions
```
